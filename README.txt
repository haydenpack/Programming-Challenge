The entry point of this program is src/app/App.java
The directory tree is as follows:

    bin - used for the compiled Java Class files
    src - used for storing our decompiled source compiled

The program's entry point relies on a StudentEntry object.
The class's source code AND its UML for it can be found in the src/student directory.

The entry point will use that class for storing the data
of various students, then output that data to the console.
